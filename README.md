Have you ever wanted to combine all the videos in one of your playlists into one compact video file?
Using this software you can!

# Download

# How-To
The program is pretty self-explanatory, however I thought it would be best to still include a how-to guide
- Download the project [https://github.com/bbcola18/yt-playlist-compiler/releases/latest]
- Unzip the file "yt-compiler.zip"
- Run "YTCompiler++.exe"
- Follow the steps on screen
- Insert a title, a valid YouTube playlist, and an image to use
- Edit the settings either through the UI settings menu or the config.yaml file if needed.
- Click the "Start!" button.
- Be patient!

# Limitations
- You can only use one photo for the entire compilation
- You can only use youtube playlists
- There may still be some bugs.

# Dependencies
This program is made possible by youtube-dlc and ffmpeg. I do not benefit from this program whatsoever.
